# likesApp
This is a simple web application using Python and the bottle micro-framework. It uses cookies to track sessions, allowing the user's input to be (temporarily) remembered. 

The application also uses the Flickr API to retrieve images of the inputted likes. 

This app was created to experiment with and learn web application fundamentals, and to practice what I had been taught in my computer science web technology unit at university.

Some of the concepts included:
- Routing
- Form handling incl. get, post, delete reqs.
- Database connections and interfaces, and MVC architecture
- Consuming web APIs
- Creating and working with AJAX requests. 

It has some bugs and needs refinement, but it served its purpose in being an introduction to a wide range of slightly more advanced topics.
